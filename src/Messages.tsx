            <Text styles={descriptionTextStyles}>You've been a true mentor to all of us. Everytime we  got stuck, you were there to guide us and to lead us along. You always supported us in all of our demos and you never scolded us despite our blunders. I would've never expected such generosity from you. Even when everything was seemingly impossible to complete, you were there to take our hand and guide us through it. Many times, we would work harder just because we knew you had supported us even in oddest of times, and that we couldn't let you down after all that you had done for us. You've taught me a lot more about leadership in this internship than I ever expected to learn. Thanks a ton!</Text>

I never imagined that I'd have such an amazing manager. Just a call/text away. It might be a small thing but each and every message you leave for us after any demo/event we had with the garage helped us a lot. Before we turn up for our presentation, we used to tell ourselves that you would come to our rescue. Thank you so much for always supporting us and making it such a smooth journey!</Text>

I appreciate everything and will remember my time here, fondly.</Text>
